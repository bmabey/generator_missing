Description:
    Stubs out a tested library. Pass the library name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored.

    This generates a module in lib, and a unit test in test/unit.

    The test case will have a mock object with the module mixed in

Examples:
    `./script/generate library email_parser`

        creates an EmailParser object and test:
            Model:      lib/email_parser.rb
            Test:       test/unit/email_parser_test.rb

    `./script/generate library EmailParser`

        creates an EmailParser object and test:
            Model:      lib/email_parser.rb
            Test:       test/unit/email_parser_test.rb
